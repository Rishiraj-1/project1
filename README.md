# 🐢 Turtle Race Game (Python)

Welcome to the **Turtle Race Game** – a fun beginner-friendly Python project using the built-in `turtle` module!

In this game, you choose how many turtles (racers) should participate, and then watch them randomly race to the finish line. The first one to reach the top wins! 🏁

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- Using the `turtle` graphics library
- Random movements and logic for games
- Loops, conditions, and functions in Python
- Creating interactive programs with user input

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

1. **Make sure you have Python installed.**  
   You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone or download the project folder.**

3. **Rename your script file if it's named `turtle.py`**  
   This avoids conflicts with Python's built-in turtle module. For example, name it:
turtle_race.py

4. **Run the script** using your terminal or IDE:
``bash
python turtle_race.py

🎮 How to Play
When the game starts, you'll be asked:
